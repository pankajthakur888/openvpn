What is OpenVPN?
OpenVPN is a popular software package which creates encrypted tunnels for secure data transfer. In this guide, you will learn to configure your Linode as a VPN gateway using the OpenVPN Access Server software, and connect your Windows, macOS, or Linux computer to it.

OpenVPN Access Server requires a paid license to use more than two connected devices.

Ensure that you have root access to your Linode or a user account with sudo privilege. For information about creating a user account with sudo privilege, see Add a Limited User Account.
Update your system. For more information, see Install Software Updates.
Allow TCP traffic through port 943 and UDP through port 1194 on your firewall. For more information, see Add Rules.
